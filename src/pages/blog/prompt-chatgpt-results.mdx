How to prompt chatgpt to get results, to get the best results you need to prompt chatgpt with the right questions.

In this example we are going to introduce to chatgpt a file, "content.json" with the purpose of getting a response from chatgpt.

Â¿Is chatgpt going to be able to guess the content of the file?

<me>Hint: it goes with a tensorflow file</me>
<chatgpt>This is a JSON file that contains information for an intent-based chatbot. The file contains several "intents", which are different categories of messages that the chatbot should be able to respond to. Each intent has a "tag" that describes the intent, a list of "input" phrases that the chatbot should recognize as belonging to that intent, and a list of "responses" that the chatbot should use when it receives a message that belongs to that intent. The file appears to be for a pirate-themed chatbot, with intents for greetings, goodbyes, and questions about the chatbot's identity and organization.</chatgpt>

That is correct, the file contains information for an intent-based chatbot. To know more about this project go to this article previously published on this blog. [blog/chatbot-tensorflow-libdevice](/blog/chatbot-tensorflow-libdevice)

Now that chatgpt knows what the file is, let's see if it can answer for a more general json file to modify the chatbot and get it to answer more questions.

<me>How would be rewrite the json file for a more general purpose and show me how would be general.json strictly</me>
<chatgpt>Here's an example of how the json file could be rewritten for a more general purpose:</chatgpt>

<pre>

```

{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "input": ["hello", "hi", "hey", "good morning", "good afternoon", "good evening"],
            "responses": [
                "Hello! How can I help you today?",
                "Hi there! What can I do for you?",
                "Hey! How can I assist you?"
            ]
        },
        {
            "tag": "goodbye",
            "input": ["bye", "goodbye", "see you later", "catch you later", "talk to you later"],
            "responses": [
                "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
                "See you later! Take care.",
                "Catch you later! Have a good one."
            ]
        },
        {
            "tag": "help",
            "input": ["help", "assistance", "support", "need help", "can you help me"],
            "responses": [
                "Of course! How can I assist you?",
                "Sure thing! What do you need help with?",
                "Absolutely! What kind of support do you need?"
            ]
        },
        {
            "tag": "hours",
            "input": ["what are your hours", "when are you open", "when are you closed"],
            "responses": [
                "We are open every day from 9am to 5pm",
                "Our hours of operation are 9am to 5pm, 7 days a week",
                "We are open from 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday, and closed on weekends."
            ]
        },
        {
            "tag": "location",
            "input": ["where are you located", "what is your address", "can you tell me where you are"],
            "responses": [
                "We are located at 123 Main Street",
                "Our address is 123 Main Street",
                "We are at 123 Main Street, come and visit us!"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

<me>how would be show me Just for learning purposes, can you suggest me more questions on the json with answers and add them? focus on the personal aspects and how make someone feel better, just show me new tag, inputs and responses, do not rewrite the whole file, just new ones, how would be show me feelings.json strictly.</me>
<chatgpt>Sure, here's an example of a new "feelings" intent that you could add to the JSON file:</chatgpt>
<pre>
```
        {
            "tag": "feelings",
            "input": ["I am feeling down", "I am feeling sad", "I am feeling depressed","I am feeling anxious", "I am feeling stressed"],
            "responses": [
                "I am sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?",
                "It's normal to feel that way sometimes. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?",
                "It sounds like you're going through a tough time. Have you considered speaking with a therapist or counselor?",
                "Stress and anxiety are very common feelings. Would you like some tips to manage them?",
                "I can understand how you feel. There are many ways to cope with depression. Can I suggest some resources for you?"
            ]
        }
```
</pre>
<chatgpt>
In this case, the tag is "feelings", the input are different ways to express feeling down, sad, depressed, anxious and stressed, and the responses are empathetic and offer help or suggestions for coping with these feelings. It is important to mention that this is a simple example, and it's not an adequate substitute for professional help and support.

If a person expresses feelings of self-harm or suicide, it is important to reach out to a professional or a support hotline immediately.
</chatgpt>
<me>List me kinds of feelings of a person in their daily life, list me 10.</me>
<chatgpt>
Here are ten common feelings that a person might experience in their daily life:

1. Happiness
2. Sadness
3. Fear
4. Anger
5. Love
6. Excitement
7. Stress
8. Relaxation
9. Frustration
10. Contentment

It is important to note that people experience a wide range of feelings and emotions, and the specific feelings that a person experiences can vary depending on their individual experiences and circumstances. Additionally, some people may experience more intense or prolonged feelings, such as depression or anxiety, which can have a significant impact on their daily lives.
</chatgpt>
<me>how would be show me add the ten common feelings that a person might experience in their daily life  you listed me into the json with answers and add them? just show me new tags, inputs and responses, do not rewrite the whole file, just this ones, how would be show me common.json strictly.</me>
<chatgpt>Sure, here's an example of how you could add the ten common feelings I listed into the JSON file:</chatgpt>
<pre>

            "I'm glad you're feeling relaxed. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"
        ]
    },
    {
        "tag": "frustration",
        "input": ["I am frustrated", "I am feeling frustrated", "I am so frustrated", "I am really frustrated"],
        "responses": [
            "Can you tell me more about what's been causing your frustration?",
            "It's normal to feel frustrated at times, but it's important to find healthy ways to cope with it. Would you like some tips on how to do that?",
            "Frustration can be a sign of unmet needs or goals. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?"

            "Contentment is a peaceful feeling. Can you share more about what's making you feel that way?",
            "I'm glad you're feeling content. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling?"
        ]
    }
```
</pre>
<chatgpt>
As you can see, each feeling has a tag, a list of input phrases that the chatbot should recognize as belonging to that feeling, and a list of responses that the chatbot should use when it receives a message that belongs to that feeling.

Keep in mind that this is just an example and you could add or remove some feelings or inputs, also you could add responses for each input.
