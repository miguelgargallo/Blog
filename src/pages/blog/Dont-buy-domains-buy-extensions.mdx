Handshake is an open-source blockchain-based project for domain name registration. It is built to work with the Domain Name System (DNS) naming system and allows users to register, transfer, and update top-level domains (TLDs) on the blockchain using the Handshake coin (HNS).

One of the main differences between Handshake and the traditional Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) system is that Handshake uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized root DNS, which aims to improve security, privacy, and censorship resistance.

Users can register Handshake domains using HNS and access them using a service like NextDNS or an alternative DNS resolver like HDNS. These services allow users to configure their devices to use a DNS server that can resolve both traditional and Handshake domains.

However, it's worth noting that ICANN has warned the public that some domain registrars are now selling alt-root domains directly to the public without providing enough information about how they work and some of the drawbacks they have.

In addition, it's not very widely adopted and support among different web browsers and devices might not be fully available yet.
