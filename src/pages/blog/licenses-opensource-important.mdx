Licenses for opensource are Important, protecting Intellectual Property and Compliance with Licensing in Open-Source Frameworks.

As a developer, it's important to understand the legal implications of using open-source software in your projects. One key aspect of this is knowing how to properly apply licenses and protect intellectual property (IP) in your code.

In the tweet @xorgconfig mentioned, he has published an entire framework and a website, in this case, his personal blog where the API is located. Both are considered IP and are protected by a license.

A framework is a set of pre-built tools and libraries that help facilitate software development. A license, on the other hand, is a legal agreement that regulates how the software can be used and distributed.

Applying an open-source license that does not allow distribution, [like the Pylar license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/superdatas/LICENSE) to a website, framework, or both, means that the code used in these entities cannot be distributed. It's important to comply with this license if it's used in your project. In contrast, frameworks often have licenses that permit their use and distribution, unless the developer specifies otherwise.

When it comes to decentralization and open-source, these values don't have to be in opposition. Open licenses are a way to ensure collaboration and respect for copyright. Furthermore, there are other options for using third-party code in decentralized projects, such as paying for audits or hiring the professional who wrote the code for custom solutions. However, it's always important to comply with the licenses established for using third-party code.

In my case, the handshake [Shaky App](https://www.pencil.li/explorer) or [the API](https://www.miguelgargallo.com/api) is on npmjs, in addition to Git and Github.

Platforms like Git, npmjs, and Cargo are secure repositories for sharing and downloading software packages. They protect the code and the rights of developers by using plagiarism detection systems and version control. These platforms are similar to other repositories like Docker Hub and GitHub, they offer a way to store and distribute code in a safe and controlled manner.
