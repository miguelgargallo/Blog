        <c>
          My name is Miguel Gargallo and I am a software developer and
          entrepreneur. I have a passion for creating innovative products and
          solving complex problems. I have a background in computer science and
          have experience working on a variety of projects, including web and
          mobile apps, data analysis and visualization, and machine learning. In
          my free time, I enjoy participating in hackathons, learning new
          technologies, and streaming on Twitch. Feel free to reach out to me on
          Twitter or GitHub if you have any questions or want to collaborate on
          a project.
