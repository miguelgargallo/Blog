      My name is Miguel Gargallo and I am a software developer and entrepreneur.
      I have a passion for creating innovative products and solving complex
      problems. I have a background in computer science and have experience
      working on a variety of projects, including web and mobile apps, data
      analysis and visualization, and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy
      participating in hackathons, learning new technologies, and streaming on
      Twitch. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or GitHub if you have any
      questions or want to collaborate on a project.
